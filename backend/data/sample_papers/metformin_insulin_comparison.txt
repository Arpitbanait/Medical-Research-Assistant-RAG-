Abstract:
Importance: The choice between metformin and insulin as initial therapy for type 2 diabetes remains debated, particularly in patients with high baseline HbA1c.

Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of metformin versus insulin as first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

Design: Multicenter, randomized, open-label trial conducted from 2019-2021.

Participants: 1,248 adults (aged 35-75) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and HbA1c 7.5-11.0%.

Interventions: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either metformin (up to 2000 mg daily) or basal insulin (glargine, titrated to fasting glucose <130 mg/dL).

Main Outcomes: Primary outcome was HbA1c reduction at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included weight change, hypoglycemia incidence, and treatment satisfaction.

Results:
- HbA1c Reduction: Metformin group -1.2% (95% CI -1.4 to -1.0); Insulin group -1.8% (95% CI -2.0 to -1.6). Insulin achieved faster glycemic control.
- Weight Change: Metformin group -1.8 kg; Insulin group +3.2 kg (p<0.001)
- Hypoglycemia: Metformin 2.1%; Insulin 14.3% (p<0.001)
- Treatment Satisfaction: Higher in metformin group (p=0.003)

Conclusions: While insulin achieves greater HbA1c reduction, metformin offers advantages in weight management, hypoglycemia risk, and patient satisfaction. The choice should be individualized based on glycemic goals, patient preferences, and contraindications.

Recommendation: For most patients with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c <10%, metformin remains preferred first-line therapy. Insulin should be considered for patients with HbA1c ≥10%, symptoms of hyperglycemia, or evidence of catabolism.
