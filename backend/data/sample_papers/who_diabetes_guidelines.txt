Executive Summary:
The World Health Organization updates its evidence-based guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults.

Key Recommendations:

1. Lifestyle Modifications (Strong Recommendation)
- Dietary changes: Mediterranean or DASH diet patterns
- Physical activity: ≥150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity exercise
- Weight reduction: 5-10% body weight loss for overweight/obese patients
- Evidence quality: High

2. First-Line Pharmacotherapy (Strong Recommendation)
- Metformin is recommended as initial pharmacological treatment unless contraindicated
- Starting dose: 500 mg once or twice daily with meals
- Target dose: 1000-2000 mg daily in divided doses
- Contraindications: eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m², acute metabolic acidosis, severe liver disease
- Evidence quality: High

3. Second-Line Therapy (Conditional Recommendation)
For patients not achieving glycemic targets (HbA1c <7% or individualized target) with metformin and lifestyle:
- SGLT2 inhibitors: Preferred in patients with heart failure or chronic kidney disease
- GLP-1 receptor agonists: Preferred for weight reduction and cardiovascular protection
- DPP-4 inhibitors: Alternative for patients intolerant to above
- Sulfonylureas: Cost-effective option but higher hypoglycemia risk
- Evidence quality: Moderate to High

4. Insulin Therapy (Strong Recommendation)
Indicated when:
- HbA1c remains >9% despite dual oral therapy
- Symptoms of hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss)
- Pregnancy
- Acute illness or surgery
- Evidence quality: High

5. Cardiovascular Risk Management (Strong Recommendation)
- Blood pressure target: <130/80 mmHg
- LDL cholesterol target: <100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L)
- Statin therapy for patients ≥40 years with diabetes
- Aspirin for secondary prevention
- Evidence quality: High

6. Monitoring and Follow-up
- HbA1c every 3 months until target achieved, then every 6 months
- Annual screening: retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy
- Foot examination at each visit
- Evidence quality: Moderate

Implementation Considerations:
- Resource-limited settings: Prioritize metformin and lifestyle interventions
- Patient-centered approach: Individualize targets based on age, comorbidities, life expectancy
- Shared decision-making: Discuss treatment options, including benefits and risks

These guidelines reflect systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials and observational studies published through December 2022. Regular updates are planned as new evidence emerges.
